### **For ABori Publications**

The following data points will be generated to assist journalists in producing a concise, yet comprehensive, summary or news piece:

- **Summary**: A condensed version of the article.
- **Layman's Summary**: A translation of the article into terms easily understood by the general public.
- **Main Results**: Key findings of the study.
- **Short News Piece**: A brief news article based on the academic article.
- **Detailed News Piece**: A news article that delves deeper, including details about the main results, affiliated institutions, the study's objectives, methodologies employed by the researchers, and the main conclusions.
- **Bullet-point Headlines**: Quick highlights of the article's key points.
- **Target Audiences**: Specific groups or demographics who might be particularly interested in or affected by the article's findings.

Our aim is to provide a seamless interface where abstracts can be submitted, reviewed, and transformed into engaging news pieces, making scientific knowledge more accessible to all.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have Azure CLI and Azure Data Factory CLI installed.
- Python and Pip should be installed on your system.

### Setting up the Database:

- Navigate to the `sql_scripts` directory.
- Use the provided SQL script (`create_tables.sql`) to create the necessary tables in your database.

### Setting up Azure Data Factory Pipeline:

- First, log in to your Azure account using Azure CLI.
- Set up the Azure Data Factory pipeline using the ADF command with the pipeline name and the path to the definition file.
- Schedule the pipeline to execute whenever new data arrives at the blob storage.

### Installing and Running Flask App:

- Navigate to the root directory of the `BoriSciReporter` application.
- Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
- Set the Flask environment variables: specify the Flask app as `run.py` and choose between a `development` or `production` environment.
- Initiate the Flask app. Once started, you'll see a message indicating that the server is operational. Access the BoriSciReporter web application by navigating to the provided link in your browser.

### Additional Setup for PowerBI and Bicep:

- **PowerBI**: Load the PowerBI template located within the `powerBI` directory to visualize your data.
  
- **Bicep**: Go to the `bicep` directory and deploy your bicep files to configure Azure resources as per your project requirements.



## Components

### Flask App (`app.py`)

Handles the application's routes, interactions with the database, and summary generation using OpenAI's GPT.

### Templates (`templates/`)

HTML templates that render the data and provide interfaces for users.

### Static Content (`static/`)

Comprises styling (CSS), frontend scripts (JS), and images for the application.

## ETL Process: Extract, Transform, Load

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is responsible for taking data from raw XML files, extracting meaningful information, transforming it into a structured format, and then loading it into our database.

### Extract Text from XML

The first part of our ETL process deals with the extraction of relevant content from XML files. These XML files contain information about academic papers, including metadata and full-text content.

Function `extract_data_from_xml` performs this extraction:
- `journal_title`, `issn`, `abbrev_journal_title`, and `publisher_name` for journal information.
- Article data like `article_title`, `abstract`, and `full_text`.
- Authors' data, identified by their names.
- Keywords associated with the paper.

### AboriDB-XML-Ingestion

Once data is extracted, it needs to be ingested into the Abori Database.

Function `connect_to_db` is responsible for establishing a connection to the Azure SQL database.

Function `insert_data_to_db` inserts the data:
- Journal data is inserted into the `journal` table.
- Article data, including extracted keywords, is inserted into the `article` table.
- Authors are inserted into the `researcher` table if not already present and linked to articles in the `article_authors` table.
- The full text of the articles is stored in the `article_fulltext` table.

The `get_or_create_researcher_id` function ensures that if a researcher is already in the database, it fetches their ID. Otherwise, a new entry is made.

### Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Managed Identity

To automate and manage this ETL process, we use Fabric ADF pipelines. The pipeline is set to trigger as soon as new XMLs containing paper information arrive at the Azure Blob Storage. This ensures timely processing and ingestion of new data.

Additionally, for enhanced security and ease of management, we connect to Azure SQL using Azure's Managed Identity. This way, we don't need to manage or rotate database credentials manually; Azure takes care of it, ensuring that our connection is both seamless and secure.

Remember to replace placeholders like `YOUR_SERVER_NAME`, `YOUR_USER_ID`, and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual credentials or connection details before executing the scripts.
